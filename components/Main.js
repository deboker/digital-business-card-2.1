                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a frontend developer with a particular interest in making things simple and automating daily tasks. I try to keep up with security and best practices, and am always looking for new things to learn. </p>
                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>I have a deep appreciation for animals, particularly dogs. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in physical activities such as soccer, tennis, and swimming. I embrace a healthy lifestyle and take pleasure in savoring craft beer, coffee, and tea. Pizza has a special place in my heart. When I'm coding, I am accompanied by my beloved boxer dogs. Although I haven't tried surfing yet, I am always open to new experiences and challenges.</p>
